# What is the difference between remove and discard
# remove: Removes the specified element from the set. If the element is not present, it raises a KeyError.
# discard: Removes the specified element from the set if it is present. If the element is not present, it does nothing (no error is raised).

# Explain the difference between the following data types: string, list, tuple and set
"""
String:
Represents a sequence of characters.
Immutable, meaning you cannot change the characters once the string is created.
Enclosed in single (') or double (") quotes.

List:
Represents an ordered collection of elements.
Mutable, meaning you can add, remove, or modify elements after the list is created.
Enclosed in square brackets ([]).

Tuple:
Represents an ordered and immutable collection of elements.
Similar to a list but cannot be modified after creation.
Enclosed in parentheses (()).

Set:
Represents an unordered collection of unique elements.
Does not allow duplicate elements.
Mutable, meaning you can add or remove elements after the set is created.
Enclosed in curly braces ({}).

# Sentence
sentence = "I am a teacher and I love to inspire and teach people."

# Split the sentence into words
